# StabilityAI
This repository helps you to create countless images based on the prompts. Don't worry, if we can't afford the premium of MidJourney. Let's Prompt and Generate the images we like and explore more.

This might be huge for those who wants to generate the images and want to explore more. 

# Steps to run:

- Go to the "Runtime" menu: In the Colab interface, click on the "Runtime" menu option in the top navigation bar.

- Select "Change runtime type": Click on the "Change runtime type" option from the dropdown menu.

- Choose the hardware accelerator: A popup window will appear with two options:

- CPU: This option runs the notebook on the CPU, which is slower but may be sufficient for simple tasks.
- GPU: This option enables you to use a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) for faster computation. GPUs are particularly useful for deep learning and other data-intensive tasks.
    - Select the desired hardware accelerator: Click on the radio button next to your preferred hardware accelerator option (CPU or GPU).
    - Please select ```T4 GPU``` or ```A100 GPU``` as this requires huge RAM.

- Apply changes: Once you've chosen your preferred accelerator, click on the "SAVE" button to apply the changes.

- Verify the change: After changing the runtime type, the notebook will automatically restart.
